# Start development server

1. Copy `.env` and `.env.local` files to root folder of the project (next to package.json),
2. Start development server with `npm start`

# Build server

Run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

# Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

# Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
